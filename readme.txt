If you're trying to use this for your research, I am very sorry.

Steps to run this thing:
  1. Run Tracking.ipynb .
1.1. 	Make sure there are multiple tracking results, IIRC there will be missing data if you run in such a way the result is one txt file.
  2. Download the result and extract it from it's subfolder into a singular folder.
  3. Run Simulator.py, targeting the folder made in step 2.
  4. Run Extractor.py, targeting the folder made in step 3.
  5. Run one of the Classifier[something].py, targeting the .csv file made in step 4.
5.5. 	Classifier.py will also plot the result, and ClassifierMultipleSim.py will add further simulated data with more variation than what simulator.py made.

If this is confusing for you, well, me too. Sorry.
